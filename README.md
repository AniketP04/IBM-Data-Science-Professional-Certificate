Line plots capture trends and changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and fluctuations.

Bar plots compare categories or groups, providing a visual comparison of their values.

Scatter plots explore relationships between variables, helping us identify correlations or trends.

Box plots display the distribution of data, showcasing the median, quartiles, and outliers.

Histograms illustrate the distribution of data within specific intervals, allowing us to understand its shape and concentration.

Matplotlib is a plotting library that offers a wide range of plotting capabilities.

Pandas is a plotting library that provides Integrated plotting functionalities for data analysis.

Seaborn is a specialized library for statistical visualizations, offering attractive default aesthetics and color palettes.

Folium is a Python library that allows you to create interactive and customizable maps.

Plotly is an interactive and dynamic library for data visualization that supports a wide range of plot types and interactive features.

PyWaffle enables you to visualize proportional representation using squares or rectangles.

Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. 

Matplotlib was initially developed as an EEG/ECoG visualization tool. 

Matplotlib’s architecture is composed of three main layers: Backend layer, Artist layer, and the Scripting layer. 

The anatomy of a plot refers to the different components and elements that make up a visual representation of data.

Matplotlib is a well-established data visualization library that can be integrated in different environments. 

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents.

Matplotlib has a number of different backends available. 

In order to start creating different types of plots of the data, you will need to import the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

A line plot is a plot in the form of a series of data points connected by straight line segments. 

Line plot is one of the most basic type of chart and is common in many fields. 

You can generate a line plot by assigning "line" to 'Kind' parameter in the plot() function.

## Geospatial Data

Folium is a data visualization library in Python that helps people visualize geospatial data. 

With Folium, you can create maps of different styles, such as street-level maps, stamen maps, and more. 

A feature of Folium is that you can create different map styles using the tiles parameter.

With Folium, you can easily add markers on maps.

The ‘location’ parameter specifies the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center point of the map.

Markers play a vital role in enhancing interactivity and adding context to maps.

The folium.Marker() function specifies location parameters.

The popup parameter provides a label upon being clicked.

Markers can be created using “feature group.”

A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable.

When creating a choropleth map, Folium requires a GeoJson file that includes geospatial data of the region.

The Mapbox Bright Tileset displays the name of every country when used on a map.
